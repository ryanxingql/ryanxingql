### Hi there, I'm Qunliang Xing! :satisfied:

I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image/video enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

**Maintaining Projects**

- [Image Quality Assessment](https://github.com/ryanxingql/image-quality-assessment-toolbox) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ryanxingql/image-quality-assessment-toolbox?style=social) Collection of the most commonly-used image quality evaluators such as PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, BRISQUE, NIQE, PIQE, etc.
- [MFQEv2](https://github.com/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0?style=social) Enhancing the quality of compressed videos taking advantage of the neighboring good-quality frames. (TPAMI 2019)
