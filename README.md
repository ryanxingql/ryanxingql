### Hi there, I'm Qunliang Xing! ðŸ‘‹ 

<!--
**RyanXingQL/RyanXingQL** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image/video enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

**Projects**

- :satisfied: [PowerQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PowerQE): an unified framework of quality enhancement approaches for compressed images/videos based on PyTorch.
- :grinning: [STDF](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/STDF-PyTorch): enhancing compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation (AAAI 2020, unofficial implementation).
- :grin: [RBQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/RBQE): enhancing compressed images blindly and efficiently using an early-exit network plus an IQA module (ECCV 2020).
- :sunglasses: [MFQEv2](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0): enhancing frames in compressed videos taking advantage of neighboring good-quality frames (TPAMI 2019).

**Toolboxs**

- :relaxed: [Image quality assessment](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/Image-Quality-Assessment-Toolbox): collecting the most commonly-used image quality evaluators such as PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, BRISQUE, NIQE, PIQE, etc.
- :heart_eyes: [Python utilities](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PythonUtils): implementing some useful functions for IO, data format conversion, deep learning, etc.
