I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image restoration/enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

My GitHub repositories are as follows:

- 🔭 [STDF](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/STDF-PyTorch): Enhancing compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation (AAAI 2020; My PyTorch implementation)
- ✨ [RBQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/RBQE): Enhancing compressed images blindly and efficiently using an early-exit network plus an IQA module (ECCV 2020)
- ✨ [MFQEv2](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0): Using neighboring good-quality frames to enhance inferior-quality frames in compressed videos (TPAMI 2019)
