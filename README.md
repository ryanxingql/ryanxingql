### Hi there, I'm Qunliang Xing! 👋 

<!--
**RyanXingQL/RyanXingQL** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a PhD student at Beihang University, working on **image/video enhancement**, **video coding** and other computer vision tasks.

**Image/Video Quality Enhancement**

- :satisfied: [PowerQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PowerQE): An unified framework of quality enhancement approaches for compressed images/videos based on PyTorch.
- :grinning: [STDF](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/STDF-PyTorch): Enhance compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation (AAAI 2020, unofficial implementation).
- :grin: [RBQE](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/RBQE): Enhance compressed images blindly and efficiently using an early-exit network plus an IQA module (ECCV 2020).
- :sunglasses: [MFQEv2](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/MFQEv2.0): Enhance frames in compressed videos taking advantage of neighboring good-quality frames (TPAMI 2019).
- :yum: [ESRGAN](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/SubjectiveQE-ESRGAN): Enhance the perceptual quality of compressed images using ESRGAN (ECCVW 2018, unofficial implementation).

**Toolbox**

- :relaxed: [Image quality assessment toolbox](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/Image-Quality-Assessment-Toolbox): calculate commonly-used image quality evaluators such as PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, BRISQUE, NIQE, PIQE, etc.
- :heart_eyes: [Python toolbox](https://github.com/RyanXingQL/PythonUtils): implement some useful functions for IO, data format conversion, deep learning, etc.
